# assassin-target-practice

# Overview
Code to produce a game with user interaction in Processing (Java).

 ## Description
 Assignment submission for a programming module.
 
 I developed a shooter style game with the help of the labs we did on Pong.
 I have included three object classes: Assassin, Enemy and Target. 
 
 The Assassin is the player and contains information on game data and scoring.
 
 The enemy is a bouncing ball that is to be shot by the target.
 
 Finally the target is used to shoot the enemy.
 
 The game incorporates collision detection and requires key/mouse interaction from the user.
